            <p className="text-card-foreground mb-4">
              EduManage was born out of a shared frustration among educators and
              administrators with the limitations of existing educational
              software. Our founders, a team of experienced educators and
              software engineers, came together in 2015 with a vision to create
              a comprehensive, user-friendly platform that would address the
              real needs of educational institutions.
            </p>
            <p className="text-card-foreground mb-4">
              What started as a simple tool for course management quickly
              evolved into a full-fledged CMS/LMS solution. As we collaborated
              with schools, universities, and training centers, we gained
              invaluable insights that shaped our product. We listened to the
              challenges faced by our users and continuously refined our
              platform to meet their needs.
            </p>
            <p className="text-card-foreground">
              Today, EduManage is used by thousands of educational institutions
              worldwide, from small private schools to large universities. Our
              impact on the education industry has been significant, with many
              of our users reporting increased efficiency, improved student
              engagement, and better learning outcomes. We're proud of how far
              we've come, but we're even more excited about the future and the
              continued positive change we can bring to education.

              At EduManage, innovation is not just a buzzwordâ€”it's a core part
              of our DNA. We're constantly exploring new technologies and
              methodologies to enhance our platform. From integrating AI-powered
              learning assistants to developing advanced analytics tools, we're

              But innovation without purpose is meaningless. That's why we place

              feedback and ideas. Our customer support team is known for its

              consider that our greatest achievement. It's this commitment to
              our users' success that drives us to continually improve and
              innovate.
